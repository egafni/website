                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>
                    For work I build artificial intelligent systems and teams.  
                    
                    In past lives I was researcher at Harvard Medical School, the first two startups I joined 
                    unicorned (Invitae and Freenome) and I co-founded Ravel, a deep learning cancer screening company which we raised $9.5M for.
                </p><p>
                    
                    I currently run a team of 7 ML research engineers where we build ML models and software for different companies. 
                    We've worked on ML projects in lots of domains: voice cloning, LLMs, stable diffusion, computer vision, financial time series, reinforcement learning, genetics, finance, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm searching for something meaningful in AI/AGI to work on!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For fun I love exploring different forms of movement (strength, mobility, dance, roller blading,
                    gymnastics), a sauna / cold plunge, and an interesting discussion.  I was a nationally ranked chess player as a kid.
                </p>
                <h4>Work</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2021-2023</strong>: Founder of Eventum AI. ML consultant and team lead for various companies 
                        working on voice cloning, LLMs, stable diffusion, computer vision, financial time series, etc.
                        Managed a team of around 10 ML research engineers working for various high growth startups like <a href="http://sanas.ai" target="_blank">Sanas</a>, <a href="http://plailabs.com" target="_blank">PlaiLabs</a>, and <a href=http://deepcell.com" target="_blank">Deepcell</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>2018-2021</strong>: Co-founder of Ravel Biotechnologies. We were a deep learning first company that 
                        built a test to detect the presence of breast cancer in cell-free DNA. 
                        I developed neural networks (vision and language), classical ML, and probabilistic models.</li>
                    <li><strong>2017-2018</strong>: Senior Computational Biologist - Machine Learning Team at Freenome.
                        Developed neural network and probabilistic graphical models for colon cancer detection. Freenome
                        went on to raise $1B from venture capitalists.</li>
                    <li><strong>2013-2017</strong>: Senior Bioinformatician at Invitae. Developed machine learning and
                        bayesian probabilistic algorithms for genetic diagnostics. Main developer, first patent author
                        of Invitae's variant calling system which determined what mutations were in a patient's genomes.
                        Patented another algorithm which allowed us to detect mutations in parts of the genome that
                        competitors could not. Invitae IPOed, become worth $6.5B at its height, and my code helped
                        millions of patients.</li>
                    <li><strong>2010-2013</strong>: Senior Research Associate at Harvard Medical School. Built machine
                        learning and bioinformatics systems to analyze high throughput genetic and health data. Worked
                        with one of
                        the first groups to do a clinical exome sequencing and interpretation out of Boston Children's
                        Hospital.</li>
